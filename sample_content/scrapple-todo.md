Scrapple To-DO
==============


* YAMLでいいやん
* Plugin dependencies
* Edit handler
* Choose handler with "as: html"
* FileLookup's options :base_paths can be substitued by a with_base_paths block method
* FileLookup should consider "/index" as a kind of relative path
* Page uses "root", FileLookup uses "base_path"
* Validate presence of content_dir (and plugin-dir?)
* Make sure raw and title-from-file is working
* plugin: breadcrumbs
* plugin: ls
* macros (execute protected ruby code inside markdown/rdoc/etc files)
* Think of a way to test plugins
* Some Rack::Tests
* Plugin: impress.js
* Authentication
    * Should I use databases? (probably not)
* Authorization
* Think about caching
