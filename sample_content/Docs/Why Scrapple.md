Why Scrapple?
=============

Well, sure,

I would use *Evernote*, but their lack of code highlighting and autoindent
support are forbidding.  And I'm much more comfortable in Markdown than in
wysywig editors.

I would use *Jekyll* or *Octopress*, but they're statically generated. It's
a personal Wiki, and I make small edits often. Can't be bothered with the
generation step.

I would use *Redmine*, but they attachments as attachments, not first-class
Wiki pages.
