Possible Changes
================

* The handler confidence system is not pretty.
  Known file types and their handler preferences should be declared elsewhere.
* Using rack middleware everywhere is a bit confusing.
* Should handle multiple backends (file, dropbox, git...)
* Auth may have to not be a plugin.
